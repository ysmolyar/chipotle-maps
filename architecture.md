# Architecture for ChipotleMaps MVP

As an expert software architect, here's a proposed architecture for the ChipotleMaps application. The goal is to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that can be developed quickly, with the flexibility to swap out frameworks or technologies in the future if scaling becomes necessary.

## 1. Overview

**ChipotleMaps** is a web application that allows users to:

- View Chipotle restaurant locations on an interactive map.
- See ratings based on a "skimpiness meter" (1-10) indicating portion sizes.
- Visually identify locations through icons that reflect the ratings (from an empty bowl to an overflowing bowl).

## 2. Technology Stack

**Frontend:**

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Map Library**:
  - **Leaflet**: Lightweight and open-source.
  - **or Google Maps JavaScript API**: More features, but with usage limits.
- **UI Components**:
  - **Material-UI** or **Bootstrap**: For rapid UI development.

**Backend:**

- **Node.js** with **Express.js**: For handling API requests and serving data.
- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that's flexible and easy to work with.

**Hosting and Deployment:**

- **Heroku** or **Vercel**: For easy deployment and scalability.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.

## 3. System Architecture Components

### A. Frontend Application

- **Map Interface:**
  - Utilize React components to integrate the map library.
  - Implement map navigation controls (zooming, panning).
- **Custom Map Markers:**
  - Design custom icons representing the skimpiness rating:
    - Icons range from an empty bowl to an overflowing bowl.
- **User Interaction:**
  - Display pop-ups or modals when a user clicks on a location:
    - Show location details and average rating.
  - *(Optional for MVP)* Allow users to submit ratings.

### B. Backend API

- **RESTful API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/locations`: Retrieve all Chipotle locations with ratings.
  - `POST /api/ratings`: Submit a new rating for a location.
- **Data Processing:**
  - Script to parse the provided CSV file and populate the database.
- **Integration with Frontend:**
  - Use **CORS** middleware to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.

### C. Database Design

- **Locations Collection:**

  ```json
  {
    "locationId": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "address": "string",
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": "number",
      "lng": "number"
    },
    "averageRating": "number",
    "ratingsCount": "number"
  }
  ```

- **Ratings Collection:**

  ```json
  {
    "ratingId": "string",
    "locationId": "string",
    "ratingValue": "number",
    "timestamp": "date"
  }
  ```

## 4. Data Flow

1. **Data Import:**
   - Parse the CSV file to extract Chipotle locations.
   - Geocode addresses to obtain latitude and longitude if not provided.
   - Store locations in the MongoDB database.

2. **Frontend Initialization:**
   - On application load, fetch location data from the backend API.
   - Render the map with custom markers based on the ratings.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - Clicking a marker opens a pop-up with:
     - Location details.
     - Average skimpiness rating.
     - *(Optional)* Form to submit a new rating.

4. **Submitting a Rating:**
   - User submits a rating via the frontend form.
   - Frontend sends a `POST` request to the backend API.
   - Backend updates the `averageRating` and `ratingsCount` for the location.

## 5. Visual Design

- **Icons:**
  - Create a set of 10 icons representing the skimpiness levels.
  - Icons can be SVGs for scalability and performance.

- **Responsive Layout:**
  - Ensure the app is mobile-friendly.
  - Use responsive design principles.

- **Styling:**
  - Consistent color scheme and typography.
  - Simple and intuitive user interface.

## 6. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Environment

- Initialize a GitHub repository.
- Set up the development environment with Node.js and React.js.

### Phase 2: Backend Development

- Create the Express.js server.
- Implement the data parsing script for the CSV file.
- Set up MongoDB database and define schemas.
- Develop API endpoints for data retrieval and submission.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development

- Scaffold the React application.
- Integrate the chosen map library.
- Fetch and display location data on the map.
- Implement custom icons and interactivity.

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment

- Perform end-to-end testing of the application.
- Deploy the backend and frontend applications to the hosting platform.
- Set up environment variables and configurations for production.

## 7. Future Enhancements

- **User Accounts and Authentication:**
  - Allow users to create accounts to track their ratings.
  - Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT).

- **Advanced Features:**
  - Search functionality to find specific locations.
  - Filtering options based on ratings or proximity.
  - Allow users to add comments or reviews.

- **Performance Improvements:**
  - Implement caching strategies.
  - Optimize database queries.

- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Use containerization (Docker) for consistent deployment environments.
  - Consider cloud services like AWS or Azure for scalable infrastructure.

## 8. Considerations for Technology Swap

- **Frontend Framework:**
  - The modular design allows swapping React.js with another framework like Vue.js or Angular if needed.

- **Backend Framework:**
  - The API can be rewritten using other languages or frameworks (e.g., Python with Django, Go).

- **Database Migration:**
  - Abstract database interactions to allow moving from MongoDB to a SQL database like PostgreSQL.

## 9. Summary

This architecture focuses on delivering a functional MVP quickly while ensuring flexibility for future changes. By choosing widely-used technologies with strong community support, development can proceed smoothly, and potential issues can be resolved efficiently. The modular design and clear separation of concerns allow for individual components to be swapped out or upgraded as the application evolves.
